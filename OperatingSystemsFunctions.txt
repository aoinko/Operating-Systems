Memory Management
The operating system manages the primary memory, which is accessed directly by the CPU. It moves memory around and keeps track of where it has been allocated. It is also separate from external storage such as disk drives.

Data Security
Operating systems have a protection system in place, in case an unauthorized user attempts to access data the data stored on the computer. These protections are put in place in the form of passwords and other forms of authentication. Antivirus software is another way to protect your computer.
